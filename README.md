# CSCI4448

Team members: Felipe Lima & Lucas Gama

This repo exixts to hold our (Lucas and Felipe)'s projects for CSCI4448 (Object-Oriented Analysis & Design). Porjects were made on fall 2021.

This repo will include a main project developed in Java that simulates a game store flow during 30 days. The simulation was divided into four milestone, therefore, the project 4 folder is the folder that contains the most complete code for the simulation as well as the biggest usage of design patterns. The point of this project was for us to better understand and implement the most common design patterns.  

Used: Java 8 or +
